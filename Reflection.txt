Hi
I spent aprox. 4 hrs. doing the assignments.
I am used to C and C#, I used to work with them at my previous work
so I think it was quite easy.
I watched the video configuring github and think it was good.
Its a bit of a threshhold beginning with C++ but once you are over it its great fun programming.
I am learning most of my programming through websites such as stackoverflow and codeproject.
Maybe you could inform about that.

Happy coding!
